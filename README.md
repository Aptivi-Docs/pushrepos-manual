# Welcome!

Welcome to `pushrepos`, which is a very small `bash` script that lets you push your changes to the remote of all your repositories found under a folder containing all your Git repositories.

To use this script, you can just use:

```
$ pushrepos
$ pushrepos Path/To/Repos
$ pushrepos Path/To/Repos "Added some sort of file"
```

To learn how to use this script, go to any link in the left side of your screen.
